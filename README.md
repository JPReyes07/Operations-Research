Operations Research (OR) is the mathematics of making better business decisions. The field explores various principles and algorithms to produce the most efficient and cost-effective solutions to real-world problems. From data analysis to modeling, OR is an invaluable tool for businesses and organizations that want to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. <br /> <br />
  In essence, the reason why I became highly interested in the OR field is not only because of its contribution to society but also because of *how* problems of varying natures and degrees are solved. There is a sense of creativity and heuristics in problem-solving while remaining mathematically objective. Unlike pure calculus or statistics, solving OR problems is fluid and strategic. Furthermore, it is closer to real-world situations. <br /><br />
  The adaptability of information, skills, and tools in numerous sectors is an appealing quality of OR. Organizations and sectors widely use it for diverse objectives, ranging from agriculture, energy trading, production, and sales to the space industry, asset pricing, military operations, and demand forecasting. <br /> <br />
